1) Why is there a need for 6 platforms? It seems that 4 of these platforms will be used by trains traveling into the metro tunnel, which means they will converge onto the same line and platforms at Tottenham anyway.

2) supposing there is a need for 4 metropolitan platforms, why do the sunbury and airport tracks split on the 'wrong' side of eachother? in the diagrams I've seen, it's made clear a flyover would be needed to get the airport tracks over the sunbury tracks between Sunshine and Albion."

Bus extension + talk about how buses could be improved.,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelbourneTrains/comments/1kuxom6/bus_extension_talk_about_how_buses_could_be/,6,Silent_Ad379,1748161717.0,"The 697 bus should be permanently extended to Narre Warren. It already has a Thursday only service that runs to Narre Warren. It doesn't stop at some of the stops within the local streets of Belgrave south, but this can be fixed by it doing U turn on the local roundabout. A few new stops should be added but not too many to keep travel times low.

Buses should be a major part of our network as they are cheaper and more flexible than trains or trams while still taking people off our roads. Buses should both connect towns with other towns and connect then with themselves. Sometimes buses want to be both like the 381 Mernda to Diamond Creek which may cause frustration with people who just want to hop over train lines.

Here I'll say something a little controversial, some bus routes, especially those ones connecting towns together, stop a little too frequently. I once went on the 901 bus and it was a miserable experience. Not just because it smelled like piss but also because it stopped every 300 to 400 metres across a straight road making it so the bus never really got up to a reasonable speed even while using the dedicated bus lane. Buses should be a competitive alternative to cars and having to take a 1.5 hour bus ride that would take 20 minutes by car isn't really setting a good standard.

Also another thing they should do with buses is to remove the ""tap on and tap off"" system and making it one singular tap this would help incentivise people to actually tap when taking the bus as imo having to tap twice on something as cramp as a bus is way to inconvenient for the average traveller and most don't tap at all. Idk if this will change how transfers work but I think it's necessary just to make the bus experience less cumbersome.

What are some extension or even wholly new bus routes you'd want? Or other improvements you'd want for the bus network?"

I‚Äôve been overseas for a month and returned yesterday. Strolled to my local station today to partake in my ritual of hope and despair (attending a Carlton game) and was greeted with trains only to Caulfield. 

Signage at the station tells me there is NO disruptions this weekend. I would say no trains between Caulfield and the City IS a disruption. Just because we can switch at Caulfield, that doesn‚Äôt mean the service is the same, especially when Metro don‚Äôt bother putting in more services on the cross city line to account for a whole lines patronage getting on board.

Having been away, I‚Äôm sure I missed some announcements on the trains during the week, but the signage is very clear that it‚Äôs all good this weekend when it‚Äôs not.

I don't think an outer SRL could happen but what about having express buses instead? Like for example a bus from Belgrave to Narre Warren stopping Belgrave south and Narre Warren north. I think it would be a good and relatively cheap way to further connect the outer suburbs

Sunshine: Future CBD of the West,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelbourneTrains/comments/1kqm49s/sunshine_future_cbd_of_the_west/,7,PromotionWeak3217,1747686161.0,"SRL East is going to help create a significant cluster from Clayton to Box Hill, a significant urban Center.

Sunshine has often been suggested as a focal point for the West. I'd suggest it can be a center to establish head offices for the North and West of Melbourne and regional Victoria as a whole. Running Vlines via Albion - Jacana can also bring connectivity to the whole Seymour regional line. Making Sunshine a viable destination for people all over Melbourne and beyond.

\- Sydenham to Melton to provide a much needed service to the fastest growing area in the city.

\- SRL North if it does come is vastly less functional for North to West connectivity than the existing railway direct from Broadmeadows. Census stats show that there are many more North<->West journeys than there are North<->East (35k each way north<->west) Why not run Vline trains from Craigieburn to Geelong via Newport with almost no infrastructure spend? (I understand very low frequency is possible given single lines, other freight traffic), however there are bridges, overpasses, etc all in place, Why not leverage this infrastructure. Surely we can get a few morning and evening services to get people into Sunshine, for a fraction of the cost of any SRL related project.

How much can we do to make the Albion Jacana route more available for passenger services? How much capacity is available until we have OMR freight lines / Bay West container terminal etc.

Surely the Sunshine station upgrade should include a platform for the standard gauge line for VLine/XPT services to the regions to support this central role!

I appreciate mostly everyone will be telling me why this \_can't\_ be done, but if we can plan for SRL North which costs 60+Billion along a route with minimal density or demand, surely this is no where near as crazy?

"V/Line never learn, do they?",91,https://i.redd.it/xq7j482fko1f1.jpeg,32,nickstransportvlogs,1747635102.0,"So long story short, short distant VLocity set VR79 today was rostered (which it shouldn‚Äôt be) on this Warrnambool service, but it had a faulty toilet and that lead to the service being cancelled.

V/Line just never seems to learn. Ever.

And yea, ofc a train is better than coach and also the fleet availability coming into question, I get it.

However, the fact that V/Line keeps putting the VR sets on long distance services when they‚Äôre literally meant for Melton and Wyndham Vale services is just pushing it over the edge now."

So... what's your guys' opinion on Adelaide's railways?,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelbourneTrains/comments/1kpi0te/so_whats_your_guys_opinion_on_adelaides_railways/,33,lucyjorts,1747568578.0,"Adelaide used to have a huge tramway network, regular regional services, and of course the Overland used to run to Melbourne daily, as a proper public transport service rather than the tourist attraction it is now. These days Adelaide's network is a shadow of its former self, and while plans have been put forth to upgrade it, very few of them have actually gone anywhere.  
  
When it comes to new projects, Adelaide always seems to get forgotten by the federal govt, in favour of funding projects like Sydney Metro West, Melbourne's Airport Rail, Perth's Ellenbrook line and the acquisition of the C-series, etc. But Adelaide is hardly a small city anymore, with the population expected to grow beyond two million in the next ten years.

So I'm keen to know... What do people who are active in *Melbourne's* rail scene, think about Adelaide's and what could be done for it?"

Journeying, I realised that what slows me down the most are the incoherent routes, and the lack of traffic light priority at intersections. Now, I know that the stupid route designs are more of a love child between bad planning, and local governments refusing to do anything about it, so I don't see that getting better unless, the Vic Gov does something about, which, let's face it, isn't gonna happen. So, that brings me to my second reason: a lack of traffic light priority. Now, I know the Vic Gov is doing a lot to improve and upgrade our network, and I believe they have thrown the idea around of giving trams more traffic light priority so, to me it seems like giving this privilege to busses doesn't seem too out of reach.

What are your thoughts? "

How can we push for greater off peak frequencies,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelbourneTrains/comments/1kpb4vf/how_can_we_push_for_greater_off_peak_frequencies/,45,altandthrowitaway,1747540588.0,"It is wonder that there's been *some* progress with the current government in improving off-peak frequencies. Recently and most notably, some vline services have a sprinkle of services added, and a few metro lines now have a minimum off peak wait of 20 minutes. This is a great start.

There still is a long way to go though. Many lines (Burnley and Clifton Hill group and others) still stuff from infrequent services, with no real indication that this will improve. Same story on vline, where many services are really crowded, with people having to stand for hours at a time on some trains. Warrnambool & Albury lines come to mind.

What can we, the public, do to ensure that the momentum of increased frequencies isn't lost? As an example, it is good to see the government make fares free for seniors/children in weekends, which will obviously increase patronage, but at a time when weekend services are already busier than pre COVID, even the recent boost of services won't be enough to stop overcrowding.

I would also hate to see the government go down the road of ""X group gets free services"" as a cheap way to win votes, while ignoring actually fixing bus routes, the city loop reconfiguration, Melbourne Metro 2  ,new tram lines and existing line upgrades, accessible tram stops etc.

I have written to my local MP twice this year, but haven't got a response. Is there a better way to raise this issue?"
