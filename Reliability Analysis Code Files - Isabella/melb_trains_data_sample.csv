Bendigo to Ballarat via Maryborough Route Idea,19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kybfuu,6,Jezza262,1748526983.0,"I know there's some interest in connecting regional centres via rail (Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo) and typically many depict the Bendigo to Ballarat through Castlemaine and Maryborough. However, I don't like the idea of rail traversing between the latter towns.

Instead, what if the line from Maryborough followed the ""freight"" path up to Dunnolly/Tarnagulla and traversed across from Newbridge towards the suburb of Marong in Bendigo and connected into the existing Bendigo line at Eaglehawk. With a potential addition of a new station close to the ""newish"" suburb of Maiden Gully.

Although it may be more costly for construction, infrastructure and passenger duration time. I believe the connection to Maryborough could promote the town more (and neighbouring towns along the line).

Marong is highlighted as a potential future employment hub, and it'd be good to develop some rail infrastructure for any potential residential boom. It'd also save time and hassle for those living on the west outskirts of Bendigo to travel to a closeby station for Melbourne travelling.

Note: I haven't really considered any junction/grade separation needed or rail corridors obstructions/complications and yes, I'm aware of the freight rail difference. I'm afraid I didn't do ""Department of Transport"" levels of modelling.

Thought I'd share. Thank you for reading.

I Completing understand that it would   cost extra and the geolical conditions are slightly challenging for engineering but for such a small expansion in tunneling distance, the outcome would be fantastic. Doncaster is  a busy and built up suburb that isn't connected in Melbournes metropolitan train network and despite being prioritised by busses, the trains are much needed. 

Sort of frustrating how so many projects in Melbourne have to get slightly dwindled down just to fit the budget.

[https://bigbuild.vic.gov.au/library/melbourne-airport-rail/fact-sheets/scope/first-stage-of-melbourne-airport-rail-gets-underway](https://bigbuild.vic.gov.au/library/melbourne-airport-rail/fact-sheets/scope/first-stage-of-melbourne-airport-rail-gets-underway)

I get it that bad decisions have been made over the decades to not future proof the design. Especially the Sunshine station upgrade 10 years ago for RRL. 

But even still, it is not adding up.

  
In 2022 they conducted an Albion flyover assessment:

[https://bigbuild.vic.gov.au/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0009/701379/MAR-Albion-flyover-options-assessment.pdf](https://bigbuild.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/701379/MAR-Albion-flyover-options-assessment.pdf)

They decided that the ground option (""Hybrid"") was not feasible, but this contains faulty assumptions that:

1. Albion station would not be rebuilt (now it is being rebuilt anyway) or be signalling changes ($2 billion is for a reason)

2. (with respect to road disruptions) Claims that Ballarat Rd will need to rebuilt, when in fact this bridge can stay as-is. I have checked it out and there is more than enough room for 2 extra tracks by either A. rebuilding Albion station closer to the Flour Mill to the West, or B. Rebuilding 50 metres South. In both cases, it will take away space for cars/trucks on the Ballarat Rd Service Road which goes under the bridge, and lose car parking. God forbid. 

3. That St Albans Rd would need a rebuild (could replace with a new road bridge alongside the old if it's so important, but only when Standard Gauge needs an upgrade to double-track)

4. That a flyover would be needed to get Sunbury tracks over to Sunshine Platform 1, which is simply not needed anymore given that 2 extra tracks and a platform is being build on the Western side of Sunshine, giving more options, including that Platforms 1-4 are going to be fully electrified anyway. 

So now we end up with a $2 billion project, which I am thrilled that something is actually being spent on rail, but in the most inefficient manner possible making rail look more expensive than it needs to be, because they are building a pointless but extravagant Albion flyover when all they need to do is swap the Airport and Sunbury lines position going into Sunshine station.

  
The Albion flyover should be cancelled.

If more money was to be spent on this project, it would be better spent on either replacing Hampshire Road bridge, or rebuilding Sunshine station from scratch north of Hampshire Road, giving it enough space to have dedicated platforms for Wyndham Vale/Geelong, Melton, Sunbury/Ballarat, Airport, Standard Gauge (5 platform pairs total, currently there are 2, proposed to be 3). 

  
Bonus: Tottenham station would be unserved until Melton Electrification under the current proposal. Flipping Sunbury/Airport will keep Tottenham station serviced by Sunbury trains until Melton is ready, without having to add an extra stop to airport trains (which are supposed to get PAX to the airport as fast as possible) or running shuttles/replacements.

I know that the front design was made with newer headlights and stuff and for “crash worthiness” but anything else? 

Was the more slanted front design for aerodynamics as well or what?

Bus extension + talk about how buses could be improved.,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelbourneTrains/comments/1kuxom6/bus_extension_talk_about_how_buses_could_be/,8,Silent_Ad379,1748161717.0,"The 697 bus should be permanently extended to Narre Warren. It already has a Thursday only service that runs to Narre Warren. It doesn't stop at some of the stops within the local streets of Belgrave south, but this can be fixed by it doing U turn on the local roundabout. A few new stops should be added but not too many to keep travel times low.

Buses should be a major part of our network as they are cheaper and more flexible than trains or trams while still taking people off our roads. Buses should both connect towns with other towns and connect then with themselves. Sometimes buses want to be both like the 381 Mernda to Diamond Creek which may cause frustration with people who just want to hop over train lines.

Here I'll say something a little controversial, some bus routes, especially those ones connecting towns together, stop a little too frequently. I once went on the 901 bus and it was a miserable experience. Not just because it smelled like piss but also because it stopped every 300 to 400 metres across a straight road making it so the bus never really got up to a reasonable speed even while using the dedicated bus lane. Buses should be a competitive alternative to cars and having to take a 1.5 hour bus ride that would take 20 minutes by car isn't really setting a good standard.

Also another thing they should do with buses is to remove the ""tap on and tap off"" system and making it one singular tap this would help incentivise people to actually tap when taking the bus as imo having to tap twice on something as cramp as a bus is way to inconvenient for the average traveller and most don't tap at all. Idk if this will change how transfers work but I think it's necessary just to make the bus experience less cumbersome.

What are some extension or even wholly new bus routes you'd want? Or other improvements you'd want for the bus network?"

I’ve been overseas for a month and returned yesterday. Strolled to my local station today to partake in my ritual of hope and despair (attending a Carlton game) and was greeted with trains only to Caulfield. 

Signage at the station tells me there is NO disruptions this weekend. I would say no trains between Caulfield and the City IS a disruption. Just because we can switch at Caulfield, that doesn’t mean the service is the same, especially when Metro don’t bother putting in more services on the cross city line to account for a whole lines patronage getting on board.

Having been away, I’m sure I missed some announcements on the trains during the week, but the signage is very clear that it’s all good this weekend when it’s not. There are 3 AFL games on today, all with staggers start times along with the usual weekend patronage so making decisions about how to travel based on accurate information is vital."
